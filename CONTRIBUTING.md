# Contributing to Testura

You want to help expand BreakIt andra make it the best break framework? Awesome! We need help with both new features, bug fixes and documentation.

# Getting started

But let's keep it simple: 

- Missing x feature? Create a new issue to discuss it before you start. 
- Finding a bug? Either create a new issue explaining the bug or fix it and create a PR for us to look at.

## Before creating a PR 

Before creating a PR make sure that: 

- All unit test pass (we also appreciate if you make new unit tests if you added a feature)
- You code follow the C# coding guidlines (the project contains stylecop so this should not be an issue). 

# Final word 

Any kind of contribution is helpful (even a simple discussion). So if you have any question you can easily create an issue, send a tweet or an email.
